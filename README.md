### Hello! My name is Lucca

I'm a student at Federal University of Bahia in Brazil, coursing Computer Engineering

About me:

- ⌨️ I'm currently learning Python, SQL, R and C#
- 🤝 I'm looking to know more people that loves programming and studying it as I do.
- 🐝 In my free time I solve problems in BeeCrowd (All of my answers to the problems are here in GitHub)
- 💻 I study courses outside the university, so I can learn more about IT automation, Data Analysis and Machine Learning (Until now: 25/07/2022)
